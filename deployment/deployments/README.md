# Client deployment

KODO for Endpoints client is an application designed to backup and restore data from client devices \(laptops/desktops\) running the Windows operating system.

{% endhint %}

The application utilizes Continuous Data Protection \(CDP\) which provides comprehensive protection for all information and is able to provide the most optimal and secure access to corporate/private data.

The KODO for Endpoints client application has exceptional and unique features that address the issues that exist in every organization:

* Continuous data protection \(CDP\) 
* Incremental backup
* File versioning 
* Deduplication and compression on the source \(endpoint\)
* "Right-click" approach restore for files
* "Point-in-time" restore
* Privacy policy, integration with the IBM Spectrum Protect server.
* User data encryption 

The KODO client software must be installed and configured on each endpoint to protect its data with CDP functionality, as well as recover data. The KODO client can be installed using the following installation method:

1. [Client installer](downloading-client-installer.md) package to deploy it locally on the endpoint.
2. Sending the [installation guide](sending-installation-instructions.md) and the links to download the KODO client installer. 
3. Using [GPO ](client-install-using-gpo-group-policy-object.md)feature or MS SCCM application.
