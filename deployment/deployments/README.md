1. [Client installer](downloading-client-installer.md) package to deploy it locally on the endpoint.
2. Sending the [installation guide](sending-installation-instructions.md) and the links to download the KODO client installer. 
3. Using [GPO ](client-install-using-gpo-group-policy-object.md)feature or MS SCCM application.
