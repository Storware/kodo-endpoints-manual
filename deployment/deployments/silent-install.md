# Silent install

You can deploy KODO for Endpoints client in silent mode. To do that, follow the steps below:

1. Download the KODO client installer and copy it to the endpoint you want to install the software.
2. Run the command line prompt as the administrator and go to the folder the installer has been copied. 
3. Type in the command: **msiexec /i KodoDesktop\_Windows\_x64.msi /quiet** and wait a few minutes.

Once the installation process is complete, close the command prompt and click the KODO icon on the user's desktop or use the "**magic link**" from the deployment email to log into the KODO server.
