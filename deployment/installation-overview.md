# Installation overview

1. Select your installation option. You have the following to choose from:
   * [Virtual appliance](virtual-appliance-vmware/)
     * KODO for Endpoints Gateway server \(requires IBM Spectrum Protect server\)
     * KODO for Endpoints Bundle server \(contains IBM Spectrum Protect server\)
   * [Quick Install (All-In-One)](all-in-one-installation.md)
   * [Installation with RPMs](installation-with-rpm-packages.md)
2. If you have chosen the **KODO for Endpoints Gateway** server or **Installation with RPMs** option you have to configure and connect an external IBM Spectrum Protect server \(see [IBM Spectrum Protect server configuration](spectrum-protect-tsm-configuration.md) section\). If you'd like to install the IBM Spectrum Protect server on the machine, ask the [Storware support team](mailto:ps@storware.eu) for assistance if needed\),
3. Once you've finished the configuration process, you can perform the [Initial configuration](initial-configuration.md).
4. In the next step, perform [Client deployment](deployments/) on selected endpoints in your organization.
5. Test basic operations to verify that deployment is completed \(go to the [Backup and recovery tests](backup-and-recovery-tests.md) section\)

Before you begin the deployment process, go to the next section to learn more about KODO for Endpoints server administration levels and administrator accounts.
