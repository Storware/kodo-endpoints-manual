# Connecting to the IBM Spectrum  Protect server

KODO for Endpoints server is using IBM Spectrum Protect server as a backup engine to store data from the protected endpoints. It's required to configure it in an appropriate way.

In the first step, log in to  the KODO Portal as the `kodoadmin` user and go to the Settings menu.

Next, switch to the IBM Spectrum Protect tab. Check, if the proper port numbers are set:

* **Port** - it should be number 1502 set
* **Administrative Port** - it should be number 1503 set

Do not change the **Nodename** name \(the **kodo.va** is the default one\). Click the **Save** button

In the **SET IBM SPECTRUM PROTECT PASSWORD** field, copy and paste the password generated by the script in the previous chapter. Click the **Update Password** button to save it. The **Server Connection Status** should be changed to "**Connected**" \(it may take a while\).  If the status is "**Not connected**", please refresh the web browser site.
