# Logging to the virtual machine

There is a dedicated user `kodo` to log to KODO server operating system. Logging as the `root` user is not allowed. 

Use the credentials listed below to log in to the system:

> **Login:** kodo  
> **Password:** Zt3edWny

{% hint style="warning" %}
## NOTE: FOR SECURITY REASONS PLEASE CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD AFTER THE FIRST LOGIN TO THE SYSTEM!
{% endhint %}

Use `passwd` command to change password:

```text
$ passwd
```

Type old password and new password two times:

```text
Changing password for kodo.
Old Password:
New Password:
Retype New Password:
```

Go to the [Setting up the network configuration](setting-up-network-configuration.md) chapter and learn how to set up KODO server network.
