# OS update

Based on the best practices it's recommended to perform periodic operating system upgrades. To do it, log in as the  `root` user and execute the following command:

```
# dnf -y update
```

The upgrade process will start without confirming the update package download. It's recommended to reboot the server after the upgrade is finished.
