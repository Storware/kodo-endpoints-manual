# Administration

You can administer KODO for Endpoints just from a web browser by logging in to the proper administration level. It can be either KODO Admin or Organization Admin level.

In the next chapters, you'll find information about each of the level portals i.e.:

* \_\_[_Admin Portal_](kodo-admin-portal/)\_\_
* \_\_[_Organization Portal_](kodo-organization-portal/)\_\_
