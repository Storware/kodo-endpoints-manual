# Administration

You can administer KODO for Endpoints just from a web browser by logging in to the proper administration level. It can be either KODO administration level or Organization level.

In the next chapters, you'll find information about each of the level portals e.i:

* [_KODO_](kodo-admin-portal/)
* [_KODO Organization Portal_](kodo-organization-portal/)
