# Using KODO for Endpoint client

Endpoint Protection has become an essential element not only for employees but also for those managing the enterprise in order to protect sensitive and critical data of the organization. 

KODO for Endpoints client is the application dedicated to backup and restore data from client devices \(laptop/desktops\) running Windows operating systems.

The application is utilizing the Data Protection \(CDP\) feature to provide comprehensive protection of any information and is able to provide the most optimal and secure access to corporate/private data. 

The KODO for Endpoints client application has exceptional and unique features that address the issues that exist in every organization:

* Continuous data protection \(CDP\) 
* Incremental backup
* File versioning 
* Deduplication and compression on the source \(endpoint\)
* "Right-click" approach restore for files
* "Point-in-time" restore
* Privacy policy, integration with IBM Spectrum Protect.
* User data encryption

At the **Overview** view, the basic information about client settings and backup status is displayed:

1. Protection status and last backup \(synchronization\) time.
2. Assigned policy.
3. Continuous Data protection status.
4. Size of the backup data protected so far. 

{% hint style="info" %}
You can pause KODO for Endpoints client just by clicking "**Enabled**" and select one from the available options \(15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, or until the next restart\).

If in  policy settings \(at the **General** tab\) the "**Allow user to modify policy**" option is set  "on", then a user can choose the applications to be protected \(the extensions for Office, Photos, Music, Video files are included\) and the locations \(My Documents and Desktop\)
