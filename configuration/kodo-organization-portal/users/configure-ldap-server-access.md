# LDAP users

KODO allows you to import \(synchronize\) users from the LDAP server \(e.g. Active Directory\).  Users will be able to use their LDAP login and password to log into the server using the KODO client.

Go to the[ Settings](../settings.md) section to learn how to configure the LDAP synchronization.
