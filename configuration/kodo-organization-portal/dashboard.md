You can obtain the following information from the dashboard: 

* Data transferred chart \(it shows backup/restore data amount from last 1/8/24 hours\).
* Protected devices \(the overall success ratio\)
* Server information and license overview \( the server uptime, license status, license usage\)
* Protected platforms 
* Protected data information \(total protected files, total protected data, average protected files, and data\)
* Protected users count \(total, locked, local, and LDAP users\)

{% hint style="info" %}
