# Devices list view

A list of devices is a collection of all registered and protected devices in the system. When a user first logs in to the system using his username and password or uses a "magic link" and the KODO server properly authorizes it, the user's device appears in the device list.

To view the list of registered devices, go to the Device view from the main menu.
