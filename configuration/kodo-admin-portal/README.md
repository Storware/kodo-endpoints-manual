# Admin Portal

Logging in with `kodoadmin` credentials you will log in to KODO Admin Portal. This is a place, where you can configure global server settings, add new administrators and KODO organizations but also manage KODO client deployment packages.

If you log in as the `kodoadmin` the following pane menu is available :

* [_**Dashboard**_](dashboard.md) - allows checking overall KODO server statistics.
* [_**Deployment**_](deployment.md) - allows to check, upload, set, and delete deployment packages for clients.
* [_**Administrators**_](administrators.md) - allows to manage Kodo administrators and display organization administrators 
* [_**Organizations**_](organizations.md) - allows to manage \(add, remove, change\) organizations within the KODO server.
* [_**Audit log**_](auditlog.md) - audit all events such as login or change settings made in KODO Admin Portal.
* [_**Settings**_](settings.md) - allows to set the email server, establish a connection to the IBM Spectrum Protect server,  update the license, set the properties of the logs, set billings statistics, and database backup.

Go to the [Dashboard](dashboard.md) chapter to learn about what useful information you can find there.
