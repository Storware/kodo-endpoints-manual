From this dashboard you can obtain the following information: 

* Data transferred chart \(it shows backup/restore data amount from last 1/8/24 hours\).
* Devices protection overview \(the overall success ratio\)
* Server information and license overview \( the server uptime, license status, license usage\)
* Protected platforms 
* Protected data information \(total protected files, total protected data, average protected files and data\)
* Protected users count \(total, locked, local, and LDAP users\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the box next to Backup or Restore to see only the data transfer for that option.
{% endhint %}

Go to the [Deployment](../../deployment/) chapter to learn more about the menu option.
