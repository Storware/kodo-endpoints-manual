From this dashboard you can obtain the following information: 

* Protected platforms 
* Data transferred chart \(it shows backup/restore data amount from last 1/8/24 hours\).
* Protected devices \(the overall success ratio\)
* Protected data \(total protected files, total protected data, average protected files and data\)
* Protected users count \(total, locked, local, and LDAP users\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the box beside the Backup or the Restore option to see only the data transfer for a particular one.
{% endhint %}

Go to the [Deployment](../../deployment/) chapter to learn more about the menu option.
