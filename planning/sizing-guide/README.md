# Sizing Guide

There are two types of people: those who are doing backups, and those who will be doing them. But just **doing** backups is not everything. To avoid unnecessary surprises the best strategy is to **plan** your backup environment/procedure **before implementing** it. In this chapter, we have collected generic hints and guides which you might find useful while thinking about your **KODO for Endpoints** implementation.

The sizing guide describes requirements for a virtual or physical machine to install KODO for Endpoints server with IBM Spectrum Protect server.

First, you need to gather information about the total amount of data to be protected in your environment. For endpoint protection, this can be a difficult task, but you need to make some assumptions because the amount of data to protect is different on each workstation or laptop.

Based on our best practice, we have prepared four configurations that are typical of most use cases.

{% hint style="info" %}
The maximum number of endpoints protected by a single instance of KODO for Endpoints server is 25,000. If your organisation has more endpoints to protect, please install another instance of KODO for Endpoints server.
