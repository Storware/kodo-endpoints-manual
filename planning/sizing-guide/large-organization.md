# Large organization

For a small  organization \(up to 2000 endpoints\) the following system configuration is recommended:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">OS platform requirements</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>at least 8 cores</li>
          <li>at least 32 GB RAM</li>
          <li>at least 60 GB free disk space for operating system binaries, MySQL database
            and KODO server binaries</li>
          <li>Network: minimum 1Gb/s</li>
          <li>30 TB for IBM Spectrum Protect backup storage space (assuming 1000 endpoints
            protected with 30 GB of data on each and a deduplication ratio of 2:1)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Now you can go over to the [Deployment](../../deployment/) chapter to choose KODO for Endpoints server installation type or go to the [Very large organization](very-large-organization.md) chapter.
