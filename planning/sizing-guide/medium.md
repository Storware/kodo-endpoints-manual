# Medium organization

For a medium organization \(up to 1000 endpoints\) the following system configuration is recommended:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">OS platform requirements</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>at least 6 cores</li>
          <li>at least 24 GB RAM</li>
          <li>at least 50 GB free disk space for operating system binaries, MySQL database,
            and KODO server binaries</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Now you can to the [Deployment](../../deployment/) chapter to choose KODO for Endpoints server installation type or go to the [Medium organization ](large-organization.md)chapter.
