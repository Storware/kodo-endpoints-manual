## KODO for Endpoints logs location

In case there is an issue with KODO server, the first thing you have to check is the information in the log files. The server has several logs files that you can analyze.

The logs generated by the IBM Spectrum Protect server are stored in the directory `/opt/storware/kodo-server/api-core/logs`

 There are the following logs in here: 

* dsmerror.log \(Spectrum Protect for Space Management Linux error log\)
* dsminstr.log \(the performance data log\)

The logs generated by the KODO for Endpoints server are located in the directory `/opt/storware/kodo-server/api-core/logs`

 There are the following logs in here: 

* kodo.log \(KODO application log\)
* server.log.0 \(KODO server log\)

If there are some problems with the KODO server, the Storware support will ask you to provide these logs.
