# Main features

KODO for Endpoints from the very beginning was designed to protect user's data in a very easy and efficient way. It is a "user-centric" solution, which means, that the user can restore his data on his own, without involving the backup system administrator.    

KODO for Endpoints has the following features implemented: 

* **Continuous Data Protection \(CDP\)** – "non-stop" data protection for newly created or changed files 
* **Self-restore function** – mouse „right-click” approach for user’s easy restore 
* **Deduplication, compression, encryption on the source** - the data is prepared 
* **Instant backup** – user transparent protection, the minimal workload for devices 
* **File versioning**– „back to the past” recovery option for users 
* **„Cross-device” recovery** –recover data from one user's device to another
* **Backup encryption**–data encryption option available for a user from user's console 
* **Bandwidth savings**– data deduplication and compression on the source 
* **Off-line protection**–data is backed up off-line, data auto-sync when online 
* **MS Outlook/IBM Notes backup** – protection for email clients archives
* **Multi-tenancy mode for hybrid organizations or MSPs** \(billing API included\)
* **Instant restore to local PC or to the original location**
* **Centralized deployment and version management** 
* **Ready for ticket system integration \(RESTful API\)**
