# Planning & Preparation

KODO is a platform that provides the protection for workstations, laptops and Windows based tablets. It ensures not only continued protection of key corporate data, but also sharing and migrating data to a new device.

The safety and manageability are our biggest priorities. Magic links deployment, LDAP/Active Directory user management and web based tools are the first step to help enterprises to manage difficult processes.

In order to ensure 100% safety, data are encrypted and all of your precious files are backed up right after saving them. The software does not wait for scheduled backup. It occurs automatically in the background as a system service. The administrator or authorized user defines the directories that require protection. The application compares all the gathered data when connecting to TSM server and if necessary performs a backup.

Before you install KODO for Endpoints, you must make sure that environment and machines that you plan to use as a backup infrastructure components meet hardware and software recommendations and system requirements.
