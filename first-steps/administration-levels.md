# Administration levels

KODO system consists of two administration levels:

* KODO administration level - accessed through KODO Admin Portal
* KODO organization administration level - accessed through KODO organization portal

## KODO administrator level

KODO administration level is the highest level of authorization. Logging in to the system with this level of authorization you will log in to KODO Admin Portal. KODO Admin Portal allows you to configure fundamental aspects of the system such as:

* Installer packages
* Administrators
* KODO organizations
* General system settings
* E-mail server settings
* IBM Spectrum Protect server settings
* Licensing information
* Billing settings

## KODO organization administrator level

KODO system allows your company to create multiple organizations under one KODO server. Every organization is a separate entity with separated data, users, policies, etc.  
Logging in to the KODO Organization Portal as an organization administrator will allow configuring aspects of the system such as:

* Users
* Devices
* Policies
* Deployment
* Organization administrators
* Data protection policies

The default organization is named “**My organization**” which is created during KODO for Endpoint server installation.
