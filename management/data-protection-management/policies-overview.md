# Policies overview

To automatically manage data protection and retention, you define policies, which are rules that you set through `KODO Organization portal`. Policies affect how much data is stored over time, and how long data is retained and available for clients to restore.

Policy is assigned to an user and protect all his devices according to the settings.

When a server is installed, by default it has one default policy. You can customize that `Default policy` or create new one.
